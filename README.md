Abstract
-----------
Ballots and voting devices are fundamental tools in the electoral process. Despite their importance, scholars have paid little attention to the broader implications of voting procedures. We contend that ballots have significant implications for democratic representation, as they affect the cost associated with voting for citizens and electioneering for elites. In this book, we explain how ballot designs affect the behavior of voters, the performance of candidates, and the strategies of parties. As for voters, we show how voting procedures structure the likelihood of vote splitting and ballot roll-off. This in turn has implications for candidates. Focusing on gender and experience, we show how ballot form alters the salience of personal vote earning attributes. With respect to political parties, ballot structure can shift both the cost, strategies, and ultimately electoral fortunes of political parties. Finally, we discuss the profound implications ballot forms have for party campaigns and election outcomes.
